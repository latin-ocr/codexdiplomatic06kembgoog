These ure the principal sources from which the
contente of the preceding volumes have been taken,
und it requires only a glauce to convince any impar-
tiul person, how difficult it would have been to make
any use of the charters while they remained dispersed
in so many different repositories. This difficulty was
greatly enhanced by the confused manner in which
the documents are heapod together in the registers
and chartularies, where no chronological order is ever
thought of. Moreover, of the whole number of docu-
menta, about a fourth, and the boundaries of nearly
all, are written in Anglosaxon‚ a language which is
not sufficiently cultivated in England now, but which
was still more neglected hy the early Not-man trun-
scrihers: to the difficulty then of non-access was
added that urising from the careless writing of igno-
rant copyiets. On all these groundS, therefore, it was
much to be desired that a complete collection should
be made, arranged in order of time, and in which the
errors of the copyists should be corrected, us far ns
our present state of knowledge permitted. This I
have attempted to accomplish ; and though I am only
too well uwure how far removed from faultless the
execution of the work has proved, I am not without
hope that it will still be found no trifling boon to the
legal antiquat-y and the philologist.
