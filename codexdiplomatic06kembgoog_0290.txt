It is obvious that the local knowledige of those
whose opportunities favour such investigatione, will
find its best* field in this class of names. 'The sug-
gestions are founded upon the analogies of other

- dual declension into English, still this is at the best
an uncertain portion of my labour, and probably is
full of errors. By printing it in a different type I
have endeavoured to guard the reader from accepting
what 800111 probabilities to me for ascertained facts3
but experience has shewn that these guesses are some·
times fortunate: since the index was begun, many
words have been removed from the fourth into the
second class, and it is to be hoped that many more
may yet 110 found worthy of a similar transposition.
