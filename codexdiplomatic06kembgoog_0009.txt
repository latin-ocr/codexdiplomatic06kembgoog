neighbours. ,

More than fifteen hundred documents have survived
the conquests and tramplings of armieS, the storm of
revolutionS, the yet more efficient and gradual changes
of sashion, and the altered forms os public and private
lise; they have survived not only to show us what

long been unintelligible, should still romain, aster

facts they teach.

The repositories in which they have been preserved
are the libi-aries of the British Museum, the Univer-
sitieS, and the various· cathedrals, and, in very rare
cases, those of private collectors. Many are yet ex-

and such a charter, in manner and form following,
and that he confirmed it. From the words used, this
confirmation is called an impe-vimus in England, a
vidimus on the continent, and the ancient chartei· is
